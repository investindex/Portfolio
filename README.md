# Building a stock portfolio

Which index funds will produce the most long-term growth? Unsurprisingly, even the most informed investors and researchers do not completely agree. Before proceeding with my recommendation, let me be clear that by proposing a portfolio of multiple funds, I am not suggesting that a more straightforward approach is a bad idea. If daunting complexity might cause you to delay investing, feel free to simplify. Some ways of doing so are described [in the next section](https://github.com/investindex/Funds). Waiting to invest will [cost you a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gn4F1VmTvM&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel) than not implementing someone’s idea of the perfect portfolio.

We should start with background on portfolio characteristics. With regard to market cap, a company can be large cap (>$10B), mid cap ($2B to $10B), or small cap (<$2B). The total US market [distributes](https://www.morningstar.com/indexes/spi/mstar/portfolio) about 77% to large cap, 21% to mid cap, and 2% to small cap. Of course there are many small cap companies, but the sum of their market value is a very small fraction of the market value of all publicly listed US companies. A cap-weighted total US index fund roughly mirrors this market cap distribution.

Stocks can be characterized on a spectrum of value-growth. Value stocks have lower share prices than would be expected based on [fundamental](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) metrics like earnings. Growth stocks are priced expensively because investors have high expectations for growth of the company's fundamentals. So it expresses _relative price_: whether a stock has a high or low price compared to the price one would expect based on its fundamentals. Value and growth are not dichotomous descriptors. As an analogy, someone may be described as extraverted or introverted, but the trait extraversion is a continuous dimension. So there are important differences between two extraverts who score at the 70th and 99th percentiles of extraversion, respectively; and some people around the 50th percentile are not especially introverted or extraverted. Because a cap-weighted total US index fund mixes growth and value stocks, it is characterized as a _large blend_ fund (where _large_ refers to the dominance of large cap stocks).

One division among foreign markets is important to understand. There are _developed markets_ outside the US, led in size by Japan, the UK, Canada, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Australia. Then there are _emerging markets_, led by China, Taiwan, India, Brazil, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Thailand, and Mexico. South Korea is usually but not always grouped with developed markets. When some people say _international markets_, they mean developed markets, while others are referring to all foreign markets. If I am referring only to developed or emerging countries, I will specify, and otherwise _international_ refers to markets outside the US.

Cap-weighted funds that invest in the total US or global market are simple, great options for many reasons.<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> However, those willing to add moderate complexity to their portfolios can improve their expected returns.

&nbsp;

## Moving beyond market cap weighting

Here I will offer advice to US investors for practical implementation of the academic research presented in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKWbW7Wgm0w&ab_channel=BenFelix). These findings indicate that while investing in a cap-weighted index fund is a successful approach, diversification in terms of risk factors and geography improves long-term returns as well as the reliability of returns. Not all stocks carry the same expected return — a _risk factor_ refers to a characteristic which accounts for systematic differences in the risk and returns of diversified stock portfolios. Deliberately taking the risks associated with certain categories of stocks carries a greater expected reward. [Risk factors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Val9CqkqmvM&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast) influence the returns of bonds as well, but those factors are more obvious. As we discussed [earlier](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#bonds-and-the-spectrum-of-risk), they are _term_ and _credit_. Longer-term bonds have greater expected returns than shorter-term bonds, and bonds with higher credit risk have greater expected returns than those with lower credit risk. So term and credit are risk factors for bonds; what are the risk factors for stocks?

The first factor is [size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uErHwq4M6pg&ab_channel=BenFelix): small cap stocks tend to outperform large cap stocks. The second factor is [value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MVSsVi1_e4&ab_channel=BenFelix): value stocks tend to [outperform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYO7xrHhqsY&ab_channel=BenFelix) growth stocks. The third factor is [quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsWgWrpzdAM&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast), sometimes called the [profitability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X13000044) factor, because quality is characterized partly by high profitability. As Robert Novy-Marx wrote [here](http://rnm.simon.rochester.edu/research/QDoVI.pdf), "Quality can even be viewed as an alternative implementation of value—buying high quality assets without paying premium prices is just as much value investing as buying average quality assets at a discount. ... Quality and value strategies are highly dissimilar, however, in the stocks that they actually hold. High quality firms tend to be expensive, while value firms tend to be low quality. ... Each of these strategies consequently tends to do well precisely when the other under-performs, making them exceptionally attractive to run together." In addition to high profitability, high quality is [chiefly characterized](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/documents/faj-second-quarter-2019-what-is-quality.pdf) by conservative rather than aggressive investment into growth of company assets. High-quality stocks tend to outperform low-quality stocks.

For a longer explanation of what factors are, see [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ6Mrrbvxzg&t=1468s&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast) in which Ben Felix explains factors to his mom.

With regard to both domestic and international markets, we can improve long-run stock performance relative to a cap-weighted index by targeting these three factors: size,<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup> value, and quality. Keep in mind that these premiums are positive in the long term, but may be reversed on shorter time scales. 2020 was an especially poor year for value investing, not because returns were negative but because the returns of large cap growth stocks dwarfed those of value stocks.<sup id="fn3">[3](#f3)</sup> Such underperformance for US value had not been seen since the tech bubble of 1998 and 1999. Stock market trends are very difficult to predict in the short term, and those who embrace any investing approach need to understand that they will experience periods of underperformance relative to other approaches. Naturally, radical overperformance is also possible. For US value this occurred in 2000 after the tech bubble popped. How does factor investing fare when stocks plummet? Because correlations are high across the market during major crashes, don't count on risk factor diversification to reduce losses in percentage terms. But your portfolio will probably recover more quickly than a cap-weighted index, and your returns in good years are expected to be larger. They are also expected to be more reliable: each risk factor acts as a somewhat independent source of returns, and those returns may deliver at different times.

An additional approach to indexing can be found in the Research Affiliates Fundamental Index ([RAFI](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/strategies/rafi.html)). RAFI indices include both value and growth stocks, but weighting of each stock is based on a combination of the company's fundamental metrics, as opposed to its market cap. The result is a value-tilted index, although there are important differences between typical value funds and RAFI funds. They are explained well by the founder of Research Affiliates in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZACmAdi7g&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast). For our purposes here, we will group RAFI funds with value funds.

Let's sing praises of diversification for a moment.

&nbsp;

## Clarifying diversification

Recall the section on rebalancing, where I focused on the importance of maintaining your intended allocation of stocks and bonds. We'll explore another way in which disciplined rebalancing helps you, in combination with diversification. Let's start with an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR7e1Y-HJxQ&t=315s&ab_channel=BenFelix): between January 1970 and June 2009, in Canadian dollars, the S&P 500 had an average annual return of 9.66%, a Canadian index returned 9.42%, and an international index excluding the US and Canada returned 9.28%. Superficially, you might think that this means an investor would've received the highest return by investing in the S&P 500 and ignoring the other two. But a periodically rebalanced portfolio with one-third allocated to each index returned 9.84%, a higher return than any of the funds with lower volatility than any of the funds! These differences are larger than they may seem — see this footnote.<sup id="fn4">[4](#f4)</sup>

Diversification among stock funds and rebalancing can provide your portfolio with higher returns than any of its constituents. This exact result does not usually occur, but the example illustrates the advantages of this approach. With a forward-looking perspective, the main benefit of diversification is that we don't know which parts of your portfolio will perform best at which times. So we take a fairly agnostic approach with regard to which sectors and countries will experience near-term growth. This is consistent with the assumption that markets are [efficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbPVTqd468c&ab_channel=BenFelix) enough to make it very difficult to select stocks in advance that will outperform the market.

From a defensive point of view, lack of diversification threatens your financial well-being. The financial advisor Larry Swedroe often tells the story of a retired couple he met in March 2003 on a book tour.<sup id="fn5">[5](#f5)</sup> Three years earlier they had been invested in a concentrated portfolio of growth stocks. They were chasing the extraordinary recent returns of tech stocks enabled by the internet, and when the tech bubble popped in 2000, they took it on the chin. Their retirement portfolio was reduced from $13 million to $3 million. These are the kind of real financial consequences to which you make yourself vulnerable if you do not diversify broadly across the market.

## Implementation

How can we apply these ideas to a real portfolio? We need to make several decisions about allocation, and precise numbers are always arbitrary to some degree. We can start with our distribution of domestic and foreign stocks. Given the great vigor and size of the US market, I have chosen to allocate 65% to domestic indices and 35% to international indices. An investor purely concerned with global market cap weighting would allocate [about](https://www.msci.com/acwi) [59%](https://www.ftserussell.com/products/indices/geisac) to the US, so others may reasonably allocate more to foreign indices. There are good reasons to avoid allocating 100% to the US market or any other country's market.<sup id="fn6">[6](#f6)</sup> Next, how can we invest in the abovementioned factors within the domestic and international markets? We will depart from the cap-weighted index by overweighting subsets of the market with positive long-term premiums.

Given that small cap value stocks have the strongest premium, we should choose to overweight them. I will assign 20% of the total portfolio to US small cap value and 9% to international small cap value. US mid cap value stocks will be slightly overweighted for the same reason, at 15%. Large cap value stocks are expected to outperform large cap stocks and the total market but perform less well than small and mid cap value in the very long run. Large cap value is highly underweighted but still represented to improve the reliability of returns: 10% is assigned to US large cap value and 8% to international large cap value. To complement value, we will assign 20% to US quality and 10% to international quality. Most of the international factor products focus on developed markets, so we will allocate 8% specifically to emerging markets. The international allocation does not have the same factor tilts as the domestic allocation, partly because of limited product offerings and partly to prevent any one portion from being too small.

This allocation style depends on using funds focused on a single factor. Multifactor funds, which combine several factors in one fund, are addressed in the [next section](https://github.com/investindex/Funds#multifactor-funds). The allocation is also highly factor-tilted, which means that returns have the potential to differ significantly from cap-weighted total market returns. Sometimes the differences will favor the cap-weighted market, but in the long run they are expected to favor a factor-tilted portfolio. Investors who are concerned with this so-called tracking error should include allocation to a total market or large cap fund.

Most markets are not as easily defined as the S&P 500. The total US stock market, for example, has a number of indices which act as a specific definition and performance benchmark. Different index funds that track a given market often use different indices. It is possible for these distinctions to be consequential, as the [third footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#f3) illustrates, but their influence on future returns can be difficult to anticipate.

Which ETFs and mutual funds can be used to target these indices? My suggestions are organized in tables in the next section, and the webpage for each fund is hyperlinked.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> Total market index funds have a lot going for them. First, because stock returns are [highly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdMDGIABek&ab_channel=BenFelix) [skewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thNrIsU88y8&ab_channel=BenFelix) — a small fraction of stocks drive the market's growth — a poorly diversified investor is more likely to randomly underperform than randomly overperform. Total market index funds provide the broad diversification needed to capture skewed returns. Second, management fees are low because their holdings are based on straightforward rules. Third, they have low turnover, which implies chiefly long-term holdings, leading to tax efficiency and lower explicit trading costs such as the [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp).

Fourth, investing according to market cap weight means funds are distributed in proportion to the available opportunity set. This has several advantages. It means most trades occur with large cap stocks, which are highly liquid and have minimal trading costs. It maximizes the strategy's capacity. Capacity for any investment approach would be reached if everyone piled on the same strategy, eliminating the risk premium after costs. Because a total market index fund distributes assets according to the opportunity set, reaching capacity is not a concern. The strategy's capacity is vast. Moreover, the predominance of large cap stocks lowers [implicit](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0015198X.2019.1567190) [trading costs](https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/JOT_Summer_2015_RA.pdf). Buying shares puts upward pressure on the price, and selling exerts downward pressure. This is because, if you are selling shares (for example), the number of people willing to buy from you at a given price is limited, and after exhausting those offers, you must move your sell price lower in order to keep selling. Trading many shares thus causes meaningful price movement in a way that costs the trader. Stocks with larger market caps are less susceptible to the implicit cost of price movement, because any given trade taps a smaller fraction of the available liquidity. [↩](#fn1)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> The existence of a small cap premium is far more doubtful than I have portrayed it until here. For evidence, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uErHwq4M6pg&ab_channel=BenFelix) and [these](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Fact-Fiction-and-the-Size-Effect) [papers](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio/blob/main/SettlingTheSizeMatter.pdf). The practical implication is that you should not invest in small cap funds with the expectation of higher returns. However, factor-based premiums like value are stronger within small cap stocks. So while you should avoid pure small cap funds, it still makes sense to overweight small cap stocks, but only the specific small cap stocks such as those in value funds. [↩](#fn2)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> How painful was 2020 for US value? For each index I will list the total returns by market price for the funds from Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity in that order. The total returns for small cap value were [5.91%](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/performance/vbr/cumulative-returns), [2.56%](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239775/ishares-sp-smallcap-600-value-etf), and [4.48%](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/performance-and-risk/31635T773). The total returns for mid cap value were [2.56%](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/performance/voe/cumulative-returns), [3.53%](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239764/ishares-sp-midcap-400-value-etf), and [4.74%](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/performance-and-risk/31635T799). The total returns for large cap value were [2.29%](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/performance/vtv/cumulative-returns), [1.55%](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239715/ishares-core-sp-us-value-etf), and [2.86%](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/performance-and-risk/31635V679). For US value, 2020 was not great but not terrible. However, the total returns for the cap-weighted US market were [21.05%](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/performance/vti/cumulative-returns), [20.73%](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239724/ishares-core-sp-total-us-stock-market-etf), and [20.78%](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/performance-and-risk/315911693). This was driven by the success of large cap growth, which had total returns of [40.27%](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/performance/vug/cumulative-returns), [38.42%](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239580/ishares-morningstar-largecap-growth-etf), and [38.43%](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/performance-and-risk/31635V729).

US quality funds fared nearly as well as the cap-weighted total market: [17.00%](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/performance/vfqy/cumulative-returns) for Vanguard, [16.97%](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/256101/ishares-msci-usa-quality-factor-etf) for BlackRock, and [16.52%](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761#/performance) for J.P. Morgan. Invesco's small, mid, and large cap quality funds returned [11.26%](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XSHQ), [26.53%](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XMHQ), and [17.43%](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=SPHQ), respectively.

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> Imagine an initial investment of $10,000, invested in the ways I described above. Over 39.5 years, a 9.28% average annual return would yield a final value of $333,000; a 9.42% return would yield $350,000; a 9.66% return would yield $382,000; and a 9.84% return would yield $407,000. For example, $10,000 × 1.0984^39.5 = $407,418. [↩](#fn4)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f6"> 6 </sup> A common argument one hears is that geographic diversification can offer some protection against downturns in the US. It would be nice if the stock markets of different countries crashed independently of one another, so a globally diversified portfolio would have a smooth ride upward. But different stock markets are positively correlated, and this is most true during crashes. Don't expect geographic diversification to act as a cushion during crashes.

There are many ways to argue more convincingly for geographic diversification. The first is to note that there are country-specific risks. The US may experience unexpectedly high inflation. This would cause lenders to anticipate further high inflation and raise interest rates. The US stock market would then suffer because rising interest rates mean companies pay more to borrow money, reducing their expected growth. Inflation is sometimes caused by factors that do not affect all countries equally, so diversification offers mild protection against inflation risk, one example of a country-specific risk.

This [video on bear markets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh9Gn58r9Fw&ab_channel=BenFelix) from Ben Felix is a great discussion of the psychological terror of market crashes. It also contains a powerful argument for diversification based on the Japanese stock market. Japan's market grew at a breathtaking pace in the 1970s and 1980s, then crashed in 1990 and has since performed very poorly. From 1990 onward, a Japanese investor with a portfolio of 100% Japanese stocks would have deeply regretted their lack of diversification. But someone who allocated 45% to Japan according to global cap weights at the time would have benefited from superior growth in other countries like the US. Ben Felix also points out that Japanese small cap value stocks have outperformed the total market, which supports risk factor diversification. I am not claiming that the US stock market is likely to stagnate; I am saying that the future is uncertain and diversification provides moderate protection from certain risks without any clear drawbacks.
