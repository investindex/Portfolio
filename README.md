# Building a stock portfolio

An additional type of indexing can be found in the Research Affiliates Fundamental Index ([RAFI](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/strategies/rafi.html)) approach. RAFI weighting of each stock in an index is based on a company's fundamental metrics like cash flow, as opposed to market cap. The result is a value-tilted index, although there are important differences between straightforward value funds and RAFI funds. They are explained well by the founder of Research Affiliates in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZACmAdi7g&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast). For our purposes here, we will group RAFI funds with value funds.
