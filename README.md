# Building a stock portfolio

Which index funds will produce the most long-term growth? Unsurprisingly, even the most informed investors and researchers do not completely agree. Before proceeding with my recommendation, let me be clear that by proposing a portfolio of multiple funds, I am not suggesting that a more straightforward approach is a bad idea. If daunting complexity might cause you to delay investing, feel free to simplify. Some ways of doing so are described [in the next section](https://github.com/investindex/Funds). Waiting to invest will [cost you a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gn4F1VmTvM&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel) than not implementing someone’s idea of the perfect portfolio.

Here I will offer advice to US investors for practical implementation of the academic research presented [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKWbW7Wgm0w&ab_channel=BenFelix). These findings indicate that while investing in a market cap weighted total US market index is a successful approach, diversification in terms of geography and risk factors improves long-term returns as well as the reliability of returns. Certain groups of companies present risks which are somewhat independent from the total market, and deliberately taking these risks carries an expected reward. The first factor is size: small cap stocks tend to outperform large cap stocks. The second factor is value: [value stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuestock.asp) — whose prices are lower than would be expected based on fundamental metrics like earnings — tend to outperform [growth stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthstock.asp), which are priced expensively because investors have high expectations for growth of the company's fundamentals. The third factor is [quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsWgWrpzdAM&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast), sometimes also called the [profitability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X13000044) factor, because quality is characterized partly by high profitability. As Robert Novy-Marx wrote [here](http://rnm.simon.rochester.edu/research/QDoVI.pdf), "Quality can even be viewed as an alternative implementation of value—buying high quality assets without paying premium prices is just as much value investing as buying average quality assets at a discount. ... Quality and value strategies are highly dissimilar, however, in the stocks that they actually hold. High quality firms tend to be expensive, while value firms tend to be low quality. ... Each of these
strategies consequently tends to do well precisely when the other under-performs, making them exceptionally attractive to run together."


With regard to both domestic and international markets, this can be accomplished by 


An additional approach to indexing can be found in the Research Affiliates Fundamental Index ([RAFI](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/strategies/rafi.html)). RAFI weighting of each stock in an index is based on a combination of the company's fundamental metrics, as opposed to its market cap. The result is a value-tilted index, although there are important differences between typical value funds and RAFI funds. They are explained well by the founder of Research Affiliates in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZACmAdi7g&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast). For our purposes here, we will group RAFI funds with value funds.

-won’t fall less during a crash
-recover more quickly, grow more quickly and reliably during bull markets	

tilting one’s investment toward value stocks over growth stocks and stocks with smaller market caps. These effects interact: the value premium is especially strong in small cap stocks.
