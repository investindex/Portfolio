# Building a stock portfolio

Which funds will produce the most long-term growth? Unsurprisingly, even the most informed investors and researchers do not completely agree. Before proceeding with my recommendations, let me be clear that by proposing a portfolio of multiple funds, I am not suggesting that a more straightforward approach is a bad idea. If daunting complexity might cause you to delay investing, feel free to simplify. Some ways of doing so are described [in the next section](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md). Waiting to invest will [cost you a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gn4F1VmTvM) than not implementing someone’s idea of the perfect portfolio.

We should start with background on portfolio characteristics. With regard to market cap, a company can be small cap, mid cap, or large cap. The terms _micro cap_ and _mega cap_ can be used to describe the extremities. Standard and Poor's [creates](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf) the S&P 500 (large cap), S&P 400 (mid cap), and S&P 600 (small cap) indices. Their market cap boundaries for small cap stocks are $850M and $3.7B; for mid cap stocks they are $3.7B and $14.6B; and for large cap stocks the lower bound is $14.6B. By this definition, the total US market [distributes](https://institutional.vanguard.com/investments/product-details/fund/0970) about 82% of its weight to large cap stocks. Of course there are many small and mid cap companies, but the sum of their market value is a small fraction of the market value of all publicly listed US companies.

Stocks can be characterized on a spectrum of relative price, where the halves of the spectrum are called value and growth. Value stocks have _lower_ share prices than would be expected based on [fundamental](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) metrics like earnings. In contrast, growth stocks have _higher_ share prices than fundamentals would suggest. So relative price expresses whether a stock has a high or low price compared to the price one would expect based on its fundamentals (in the context of its industry). In general, growth stocks have expensive prices relative to current fundamentals because investors have high expectations for growth of the company.

Many people conflate growth of a company and growth of its stock price. Not [knowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J8Mhyjcbtw&t=1320s) the [distinction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEwwtjDo1dU&t=709s), some people even think that a fund with "growth" in its title implies the expectation of greater long-term returns (e.g., Vanguard's [small cap growth ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vbk)). As we'll see below, the opposite is true: value stocks have higher risk and higher expected return. Value and growth are not dichotomous descriptors. As an analogy, someone may be described as extraverted or introverted, but the trait extraversion is a continuous dimension. So there are important differences between two extraverts who score at the 70th and 99th percentiles of extraversion, respectively; and some people around the 50th percentile are not especially introverted or extraverted. Because a cap-weighted total US index fund mixes growth and value stocks, it is characterized as a _large blend_ fund (where _large_ refers to the dominance of large cap stocks).

One division among foreign markets is important to understand. There are _developed markets_ outside the US, led in size by Japan, the UK, Canada, France, Switzerland, Australia, and Germany. Then there are _[emerging markets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEV49qY0TP8)_, led by China, India, Taiwan, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Russia, Thailand, and Mexico. South Korea is grouped with developed markets by FTSE indices and [with emerging markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/10/korea-and-taiwan-arent-developed-enough-for-msci.html) by MSCI. When some people say "international markets", they mean developed markets. The titles of the funds [SCHF](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schf), [SWISX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swisx), and [FSPSX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911727) indicate that they invest in "international" equity. We can check each fund's composition and find that they invest only in developed markets. If you're noticing that this convention leads to ambiguity in the word "international", you are right. The funds [VXUS](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vxus) and [IXUS](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/244048/ishares-core-msci-total-international-stock-etf) resolve this ambiguity with the phrase "total international". In this guide, if I'm referring only to developed or emerging countries, I will specify, and otherwise "international" refers to all markets outside the US.

Cap-weighted funds that invest in the total global market are simple, great options for many reasons.<sup id="fn1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> Many people would be well-advised to buy [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) for their stock allocation and put their feet up. However, those willing to add moderate complexity to their portfolios can be rewarded for their efforts.

&nbsp;

## Moving beyond market cap weighting

Unfortunately, the method most Americans seem to employ when selecting stock funds is to check which funds have performed well recently in their domestic market. Perhaps they'll add 10 or 20% to an international fund as a cursory measure of diversification. But there are many decades of of data and careful analysis we can draw on to build a portfolio with the characteristics we desire. Here I will offer advice on how to apply the academic research that led to the Fama-French [five-factor model](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio/blob/main/FamaFrench2015.pdf), which is explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKWbW7Wgm0w). These findings indicate that while investing in a cap-weighted index fund is a successful approach, diversification in terms of risk factors and geography improves long-term returns as well as the reliability of returns.

Not all stocks carry the same expected return — a _risk factor_ refers to a characteristic which accounts for systematic differences in the risk and returns of diversified stock portfolios. Deliberately taking the risks associated with certain categories of stocks carries a greater expected reward. [Risk factors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Val9CqkqmvM) influence the returns of bonds as well, but those factors are more obvious. As we discussed [earlier](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#understanding-bonds-and-their-risks), they are _term_ and _credit_. Longer-term bonds have greater expected returns than shorter-term bonds, and bonds with higher credit risk have greater expected returns than those with lower credit risk. So term and credit are risk factors for bonds; what are the risk factors for stocks?

The first factor is simply the market factor: a cap-weighted stock market index tends to outperform the risk-free rate of return (the return on the lowest-risk assets like [one-month US treasury bills](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/314116/ishares-0-3-month-treasury-bond-etf-fund)). A cap-weighted index fund like VT has exposure to only the market factor. The second factor is [size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uErHwq4M6pg): small cap stocks tend to outperform large cap stocks. The third factor is [value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MVSsVi1_e4) (or relative price): value stocks tend to [outperform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYO7xrHhqsY) growth stocks. The fourth factor is [profitability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsWgWrpzdAM): stocks with robust profitability tend to outperform stocks with weak profitability. And the fifth factor is investment: stocks with conservative investment into growth of company assets tend to outperform those with aggressive investment. The stocks which tend to outperform, like value stocks, deliver a higher expected return because of their greater risk.<sup id="fn2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> This implies that an individual can choose to invest in _less_ risky stocks if it [suits their circumstances and risk tolerance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrL2BR0MNM&t=1499s).

A common misunderstanding is that buying a fund with value stocks means that you're investing in the value factor. However, the value factor is [actually](https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Five-Factor-Investing-with-ETFs.pdf#page=10) the return of value stocks _minus_ the return of growth stocks. If value stocks return 9% and growth stocks return 5%, then the value factor returned 4%. This is synonymous with saying that the value premium was 4%. However, if value stocks return 12% and growth stocks return 20%, then the value premium was -8%. The value factor can have a negative return even if value stocks have a positive return. The opposite can occur as well, as in 2022 when value stocks fell, but growth stocks fell by much more. The result is a positive value premium in 2022.

So when we buy value funds, we're not investing in a pure value factor portfolio. Instead, we're tilting our portfolio toward the value factor by overweighting value stocks and underweighting growth stocks. The same applies to the other factors.

We've established that there are risk premiums for these factors: size, value, profitability, and investment (in addition to the market itself). But while the premiums are positive in the long run, they are sometimes reversed on shorter time scales. Factor-tilted portfolios cannot provide constant outperformance, because their higher returns are the result of a different risk profile. That risk must entail underperformance during some periods, or it wouldn't actually be risk. 2020 was an especially poor year for value investing, not because returns were negative but because the returns of growth stocks [dwarfed](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2020&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=VUG&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=AVUV&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=VBK&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=DFLVX&allocation3_3=100) those of value stocks. Stock market trends are very difficult to predict in the short term, and those who embrace _any_ investing approach need to understand that they will experience periods of underperformance relative to other approaches. Naturally, radical outperformance is also possible. For US value this occurred in [2000-2004](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2004&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=VIGRX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=DFSVX&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=VISGX&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=DFLVX&allocation3_3=100) after the tech bubble popped, and in 2022 during a [crash led by growth stocks](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2021&firstMonth=11&endYear=2022&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=VUG&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=AVUV&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=VBK&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=AVLV&allocation3_3=100).

A recent period from 2017-2020, in which US value stocks were [beaten handily](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2017&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=VUG&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=DFSVX&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=VBK&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=DFLVX&allocation3_3=100) by US growth stocks, caused many people to question the value premium (value returned with superior performance in [2021](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2021&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=VUG&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=AVUV&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=VBK&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=DFLVX&allocation3_3=100) and [2022](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2022&firstMonth=1&endYear=2022&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=VUG&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=AVUV&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=VBK&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=DFLVX&allocation3_3=100)). There will always be people who think trends in the last five or ten years upturn everything we know about investing. But we can observe data on the impressive historical consistency of factor premiums, and find that someone with a long time horizon is very likely to reap the risk premiums of these factors. Since 1926 in the US, the value premium [has been positive](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html) in 66% of three-year periods, 85% of ten-year periods, and 97% of 20-year periods. In the plot below, each data point indicates the value premium over the prior three years (red) or the prior 20 years (purple). The value factor is volatile over short timespans, and has been negative over many three-year periods. However, it has been positive over nearly all 20-year periods. The average premium has been 3.0%. More details about the analysis are in this footnote.<sup id="fn3">[[3]](#f3)</sup>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio/blob/main/US%20Value%20Factor.png"/>
</p>

The small cap premium is notably weaker and less reliable than the others. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uErHwq4M6pg) and [these](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Fact-Fiction-and-the-Size-Effect) [papers](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio/blob/main/SettlingTheSizeMatter.pdf) for evidence. The practical implication is that you shouldn't invest in small cap funds with a strong expectation of higher returns. However, some factor premiums are stronger _within_ small cap stocks, so it still makes sense to overweight certain small caps, like those in value funds. The average magnitude of the value premium among US small caps has been 4.7%, compared to 2.1% among large caps. Among US small caps, the value premium has been positive in 73% of three-year periods, 92% of ten-year periods, and 99% of 20-year periods. <sup id="fn4">[[4]](#f4)</sup>

</p>

The market factor is the return of the cap-weighted market minus the risk-free rate of return (the return of one-month US Treasury bills). This is the basic compensation an investor receives for accepting the risk of stocks instead of a guaranteed return. The average magnitude of the US market factor has been 6.4%, and it's been positive in 78% of three-year periods, 86% of ten-year periods, and 100% of 20-year periods. Notice in the plot below that the other factors — except size, as we discussed — are roughly as consistent over long periods as the market factor. These factors are [persistent in other countries](https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Five-Factor-Investing-with-ETFs.pdf) as well. If you believe that investing in cap-weighted stocks is a worthwhile risk, you should consider exposing your portfolio to these premia as well.

In rolling 10-year periods [from 1963 to 2020](https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Five-Factor-Investing-with-ETFs.pdf#page=16), value stocks beat growth stocks 86% of the time, stocks with robust profitability beat stocks with weak profitability 86% of the time, and stocks with conservative investment beat those with aggressive investment 98% of the time. All three of these premiums were positive in 100% of rolling 20-year periods. The cap-weighted market beat risk-free returns in only 80% of 10-year periods, although we can rest assured that it also reached 100% consistency in 20-year periods. So the value, profitability, and investment premiums have been more consistent than stocks beating risk-free bonds! These are US data, but the factors are [persistent](https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Five-Factor-Investing-with-ETFs.pdf#page=16) in other countries as well.

One fascinating research result is illuminated by the value premium. A widespread assumption is that the positive returns of the cap-weighted stock market depend on the emergence of new, revolutionary companies. Presumably an index that never updated, and kept only old companies would fall further and further behind an index that represented the evolving broad market. Jeremy Siegel and Jeremy Schwartz [showed](https://github.com/investindex/Vocab#f1) that this is untrue with an intriguing question and finding. The question: what would the returns of the S&P 500 be if the index had never updated, keeping the same companies for decades? The answer: the original S&P 500 companies from 1957 delivered far better returns than the actual S&P 500 index! One explanation for this is familiar to those who understand the value premium. Siegel wrote: "Although the earnings and sales of many of the new firms grew faster than those of the older firms, the price that investors paid for these stocks was simply too high to generate good returns." The original S&P 500 was much more heavily allocated to value stocks, and had higher returns.

For a longer explanation of what factors are at a beginner level, see [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ6Mrrbvxzg&t=1468s) in which Ben Felix explains factors to his mom. For a more advanced explanation, see [this footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#f2) in the next section. It will help resolve questions caused by a superficial understanding of factors, such as: how could more profitable stocks be riskier? The bottom line is that factors do not travel alone: selecting stocks with low relative price is good, but any multifactor model indicates a risk premium for stocks with low relative price while _also_ controlling for the other factors (most notably profitability). This motivates selection of stocks for low relative price and high profitability simultaneously, rather than in separate parts of a portfolio. I'll conclude in the next section that the best management from this perspective is provided by Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) and Avantis Investors.

Optional knowledge: An additional approach to indexing can be found in the Research Affiliates Fundamental Index ([RAFI](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/strategies/rafi.html)). RAFI indices include both value and growth stocks, but weighting of each stock is based on a combination of the company's fundamental metrics, as opposed to its market cap. The result is a value-tilted index, although there are important differences between typical value funds and RAFI funds. They are explained well by the founder of Research Affiliates in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZACmAdi7g).

Let's sing praises of diversification for a moment.

&nbsp;

## Clarifying diversification

Increasing _risk-adjusted return_ is one of the central goals of rational investing. Risk is often operationalized as volatility. If someone changes a portfolio to achieve higher return while keeping volatility constant, or to reduce volatility while keeping return constant, they have increased the risk-adjusted return. Diversification is the main mechanism for doing so. Investing in assets that have low or moderate correlations with one another enhances the risk-adjusted return of the overall portfolio. <!-- It is a common misconception that it's good to invest in negatively correlated assets. Imagine two assets that are perfectly negatively correlated, at -1. The returns of one would always neutralize some of the returns of another, making it pointless to hold both. So why do people talk about negatively correlated assets? Because they don't mean they want assets with returns that are negatively correlated overall. They want assets with _conditionally_ negative correlations. In particular, they want --> In particular, investors seek assets with positive returns when stocks are crashing. High-quality bonds are the most common potential hedge against crashes in the equity market.

Ideally, a portfolio will contain diversified assets that succeed and fail at somewhat different times, making routine volatility as well as the largest crashes more tolerable. Volatility is undesirable not only because it's uncomfortable: it increases the uncertainty of your wealth at any given future point, and therefore your [uncertainty about lifetime consumption](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/insights/five-things-i-know-about-investing). These concepts lead us to an important insight: the expected return and volatility of an asset are _not_ what we care about. __We care only about how an asset will affect the expected return and volatility of our entire portfolio.__ Short-term US Treasury bonds are far less volatile than long-term US Treasury bonds. But high-quality bonds often perform well when stocks are crashing. Potentially large positive returns from bonds with longer duration can partly counteract the negative stock returns and reduce volatility — much more than short-term bonds would.

Recall the [section on rebalancing](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#rebalancing--risk-maintenance), where I focused on the importance of maintaining your intended allocation of stocks and bonds. We'll explore another way in which disciplined rebalancing helps you, in combination with diversification. Let's start with an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR7e1Y-HJxQ&t=315s): between January 1970 and June 2009, in Canadian dollars, the S&P 500 had an average annual return of 9.66%, a Canadian index returned 9.42%, and an international index excluding the US and Canada returned 9.28%. Superficially, you might think that this means an investor would've received the highest return by investing in the S&P 500 and ignoring the other two. But a periodically rebalanced portfolio with one-third allocated to each index returned 9.84%, a higher return than any of the funds with lower volatility than any of the funds! Over a period as long as four decades, these differences are more significant than they may seem.<sup id="fn5">[[5]](#f5)</sup>

So diversification among stock funds and rebalancing can provide your portfolio with higher returns than any of its constituents. This exact result does not usually occur — it requires that the different funds have pretty similar returns — but the example illustrates the advantages of this approach. Rebalancing into the funds that have recently underperformed is a counterintuitive but effective practice — it makes a portfolio into more than the sum of its parts. This is true not only among stocks, but between asset classes. Rebalancing also serves to restore the intended portfolio, with its original risk and expected return.

From a defensive point of view, lack of diversification threatens your financial well-being. The financial advisor Larry Swedroe often tells the story of a retired couple he met in March 2003 on a book tour.<sup id="fn6">[[6]](#f6)</sup> Three years earlier they had been invested in a concentrated portfolio of growth stocks. They were chasing the extraordinary recent returns of tech stocks enabled by the internet, and when the tech bubble burst in 2000, they took it on the chin. Their retirement portfolio was reduced from $13 million to $3 million. This is an extreme example, but not an anomaly. These are the kind of real financial consequences to which you make yourself vulnerable if you concentrate your portfolio in a small number of similar stocks and fail to diversify broadly across the market. See, for instance, how the stock prices of [Oracle](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORCL), [Intel](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC), [Cisco](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CSCO) and [Qualcomm](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCOM) behaved in 2000 and imagine buying shares as they approached their peaks. Wikipedia has a good [roundup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_affected_by_the_Dot-Com_Bubble) of companies with multibillion dollar valuations that declared bankruptcy or fell drastically in valuation in the early 2000s.

Another growth stock frenzy deflated recently in 2021 and 2022. Many well-known, large cap stocks took major blows. The [total US market](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VTI) suffered a drawdown of 25% this year. Meanwhile, there were drawdowns of: 54% for [Amazon](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN), 57% for [Tesla](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA), 55% for [Salesforce](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRM), 77% for [Meta](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META) (formerly Facebook), 76% for [Netflix](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX), 66% for [Nvidia](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA), 65% for [AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD), 77% for [Paypal](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PYPL), 82% for [Block](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ) (formerly Square), 87% for [Zillow](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/Z), 79% for [Spotify](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPOT), 85% for [Shopify](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SHOP), 76% for [Moderna](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MRNA), 87% for [Coinbase](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COIN), 88% for [Rivian](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIVN), 82% for [DoorDash](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DASH), 90% for [Roku](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU), 83% for [Palantir](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLTR), 82% for [Cloudflare](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NET), 91% for [Snap](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP) (formerly Snapchat), 87% for [Zoom](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM), 96% for [Peloton](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PTON), and 98% for [Carvana](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVNA). For those who thought companies like these seemed like exciting investments, it has been a hard year.

#### Risk factor diversification

Some of the factor funds, like small cap value, will exhibit higher volatility than the cap-weighted total market. But this doesn't imply that factor investing needs to deliver a more volatile portfolio. In other words, although factor investing involves overweighting riskier stocks, it is not necessarily a riskier approach. To the contrary, investing in a variety of funds that are not perfectly correlated means that each risk factor acts as a somewhat independent source of returns, and those returns tend to deliver at different times.

A prominent [example](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2009&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=VTSMX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=DFSVX&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=DFLVX&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=SPY&allocation3_3=100) is the entire decade of 2000-2009, in which the total US market and [S&P 500](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy) had negative average annual returns (-0.27% and -1.01%, respectively). It is often called the _lost decade_ because stock returns in the US and some other countries were so poor. But it was not lost for value stocks: a US large cap value [fund](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dflvx/us-large-cap-value-portfolio-i) returned an average annual 4.39% and a US small cap value [fund](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dfsvx/us-small-cap-value-portfolio-i) returned an average 9.13%. The 2000s also illustrated the value of geographic diversification: Vanguard's emerging markets fund [returned](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2009&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=DISVX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VEIEX&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=DFEVX&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=DFIVX&allocation3_3=100) an average 9.82%, an emerging markets value [fund](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dfevx/emerging-markets-value-portfolio-i) returned an average 13.88%, a developed markets value [fund](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dfivx/international-value-portfolio-i) returned an average 6.67%, and a developed markets small cap value [fund](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/disvx/international-small-cap-value-portfolio-i) returned an average 11.27%. Many naive investors, who base all of their investment knowledge on the last decade and think the S&P 500 can do no wrong, should peer a little further back in history.

Below is the total return chart for [SPY](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy), the first S&P 500 ETF and — fun fact — the security with the highest trading volume in the world. Two deep bear markets made the 2000s a bad time to invest in large cap US stocks.

Even when the movement of funds with varied exposure to different risk factors or different countries is the same directionally, one market subset may gain more or lose less than another. The smoother returns of a global portfolio with multiple risk factors are thanks to the free lunch of diversification.

How does factor investing fare when stocks plummet? Because correlations are high across the market during major crashes, don't count on risk factor diversification to reduce losses in percentage terms. As I explained in [this footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#f2), a portfolio that overweights value stocks will often — but not always — experience greater drawdowns than the cap-weighted market. However, that portfolio will probably recover more quickly than a cap-weighted index, and its returns in good years are expected to be larger and more reliable.

See this section's [last footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#f7) for more on geographic diversification.

&nbsp;

## Implementation

How can we apply these ideas to a real portfolio? First we can consider geographic allocation. An investor purely concerned with global market cap weighting would allocate [about 60%](https://www.ftserussell.com/products/indices/geisac) to the US, 29% to other developed markets, and 11% to emerging markets (assuming you count South Korea, 1.5% of the total, as a developed market). Many investors have a home country bias, and US investors in particular think their chauvinism is justified by the recent domestic returns (which were [16%, on average](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2012&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VTI&allocation1_1=100), from 2012 to 2021). But a large home country bias [is not sensible](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f1) regardless of where you live, and there are good reasons to avoid allocating 100% to the US market or any other country's market.<sup id="fn7">[[7]](#f7)</sup> In the [section on psychology](https://github.com/investindex/Psychology#common-fallacies-for-investors), I elaborate on why recent past returns are a poor guide for selecting investments. I recommend 50-65% allocation to the US; in other words, allocate as if you were an alien and did not acknowledge divisions between countries. 60% is allocated to the US because that's where 60% of market value is domiciled. There are some evidence-based ways of deviating from geographic market caps, but most of them would suggest underweighting rather than overweighting the US.

We should, however, depart from global cap weights by overweighting subsets of the market with positive long-term premiums. These are stocks with low relative price (value stocks) and high profitability. As discussed above, size is an unreliable risk factor on its own. But because some factor premiums are stronger _within_ small cap stocks, we should overweight small cap value stocks, especially those with high profitability. These stocks arguably have the highest expected return of any category.

This may cause some people to wonder why it isn't advisable to invest _only_ in small cap value stocks. There is indeed a strong case that great returns would be expected for someone with this portfolio if they had a time horizon of at least 20 years and an iron will. But over the course of those 20+ years, there would undoubtedly be periods of significant [underperformance](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#f3) compared to a more typical portfolio, like a cap-weighted global fund. For most people, these periods would be so psychologically punishing that it's doubtful they would be able to avoid changing their allocation or bailing out of stocks altogether. And of course, it's not certain that even over 20 years, small cap value stocks will continue to outperform. For augmented returns that are more reliable, we should invest in globally diversified stocks across all market capitalizations and with different relative price and profitability characteristics. We can overweight some stocks without reaching the extreme of omitting the underweighted stocks. The reliability of our returns will be the gift of risk factor diversification and geographic diversification.

Which ETFs and mutual funds can be used to build a portfolio with these characteristics? Various suggestions are organized in tables in the next section, and the webpage for each fund is hyperlinked.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> Total market index funds have a lot going for them. First, because stock returns are [positively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdMDGIABek) [skewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thNrIsU88y8) — a small fraction of stocks drive the market's growth — a poorly diversified investor is more likely to randomly underperform than randomly overperform. Total market index funds provide the broad diversification needed to capture skewed returns. Second, management fees are low because their holdings are based on straightforward rules. Third, they have low turnover, which implies chiefly long-term holdings, leading to tax efficiency and lower explicit trading costs such as the [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp).

Fourth, investing according to market cap weight means funds are distributed in proportion to the available opportunity set. This has several advantages. It means most trades occur with large cap stocks, which are highly liquid and have minimal trading costs. It maximizes the strategy's capacity. Capacity for any investment approach would be reached if everyone piled on the same strategy, eliminating the risk premium after costs. Because a total market index fund distributes assets according to the opportunity set, reaching capacity is not a concern. The strategy's capacity is vast. Moreover, the predominance of large cap stocks means that [implicit](https://alphaarchitect.com/2018/08/14/the-best-research-paper-ever-written-on-trading-costs/) [trading](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0015198X.2019.1567190) [costs](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio/blob/main/MarketImpactTrading.pdf) are low. Buying shares puts upward pressure on the price, and selling exerts downward pressure. This is because, if you are selling shares (for example), the number of people willing to buy from you at a given price is limited, and after exhausting those offers, you must move your sell price lower in order to keep selling. Trading many shares thus causes meaningful price movement in a way that costs the trader. Stocks with larger market caps are less susceptible to the implicit cost of price movement, because any given trade taps a smaller fraction of the available liquidity. [↩](#fn1)

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> Value stocks are not just generically riskier and more volatile than growth stocks, moving up and down in greater amounts. [Specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH1pJwRn-gQ&t=1358s), value stocks are [economically vulnerable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrL2BR0MNM&t=3390s) and tend to perform poorly during economic slowdowns and contractions. This is exactly when investors are most adverse to large losses, partly because their portfolios are already suffering painful drawdowns, and partly because their own financial security is often at greater risk during an economic recession. On the other hand, value stocks thrive when economic recovery and expansion is expected.

We can observe this in the most recent stock market crashes. In February and March 2020, [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti), Vanguard's total US stock fund, drew down by 35.0%, while [DFLVX](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dflvx/us-large-cap-value-portfolio-i), a US large cap value fund, drew down by 41.0% and [AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html)/[DFSVX](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dfsvx/us-small-cap-value-portfolio-i), US small cap value funds, drew down by 46.9%/47.6%. The greater losses for value stocks occurred in the context of widespread anxiety about the economy and public health; many people became unemployed. Value investors need to understand that the additional risk they're choosing to bear will manifest as greater losses precisely when loss is most unpleasant. If you lose your job and need to sell your stocks at the bottom of a crash, you won't reap the value premium. Value stocks also underperformed during the global financial crisis: between the peak in October 2007 and the trough in March 2009, total return was -55.4% for [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti), -63.7% for [DFLVX](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dflvx/us-large-cap-value-portfolio-i), and -64.1% for [DFSVX](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dfsvx/us-small-cap-value-portfolio-i). However, the compensation for bearing the risk of value stocks emerges most powerfully during economic recovery.

Let me be clear that value stocks do not always underperform growth stocks during periods of negative return for the total market. The period [2000-2002](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2002&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=VIGRX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=DFSVX&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=VISGX&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=DFLVX&allocation3_3=100) was a notable demonstration of this in the US. In 2022 the US experienced negative returns that were led by growth stocks. They were due to concerns related to inflation and rising interest rates, and exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Between their respective peaks and troughs, the total US market fund [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti) drew down by 25.4%, the US large cap growth fund [VUG](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vug) by 35.6%, the US small cap growth [VBK](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vbk) fund by 38.4%, the US large cap value funds [AVLV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf.html)/[DFLVX](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dflvx/us-large-cap-value-portfolio-i) by 19.3%/19.8%, and the US small cap value funds [AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html)/[DFSVX](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/funds/dfsvx/us-small-cap-value-portfolio-i) by 20.6%/18.0%. 

Value stocks are not _simply_ riskier than growth stocks, but exposed to different risks. [↩](#fn2)

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> The academic value factor is conventionally defined as a portfolio of the 30% of stocks with the highest book-to-price minus a portfolio of the 30% of stocks with the lowest book-to-price. This leads to the abbreviation "high minus low" or HML. In addition, each portfolio is split evenly between large cap and small cap stocks, so the academic value factor overweights small caps. In the plot of the US value factor, the factor is calculated for each lookback period with a one-month step. So the three-year lookback starts with Jul 1926 - Jun 1929, the second data point is Aug 1926 - Jul 1929, and so on. The first data points for the 20-year lookback are Jul 1926 - Jun 1946, Aug 1926 - Jul 1946, and so on. The data are taken from [Ken French's library](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html). Ben Felix wrote an [excellent whitepaper](https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Five-Factor-Investing-with-ETFs.pdf) about these data, but since it is more than two years out of date, I did my own analysis.

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> Jack Vogel of [Alpha Architect](https://alphaarchitect.com/) recently published a [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4078256) showing that if a large cap value portfolio is equal-weighted rather than market cap-weighted, its returns are about as strong as those of a small cap value portfolio. All other things equal, large caps are better because they have lower trading costs (see footnote 1 above). Equal-weighted value portfolios are available through Alpha Architect and are discussed in the [next section](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#beyond-mainstream-factor-funds).

The paper linked in the main text on the size factor is from authors at AQR Capital. For the interested reader, they have also written papers on the [value](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Fact-Fiction-and-Value-Investing) and [momentum](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Fact-Fiction-and-Momentum-Investing) factors, the latter of which is not part of the Fama-French [five-factor model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X14002323) discussed above. The AQR papers are accessibly written and provide a window into some of the disagreements surrounding risk factors. [This paper](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio/blob/main/DevilHMLDetails.pdf) is an interesting commentary on how slightly altering the definition of value can increase the value premium. Finally, these [two](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3969743) [papers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3325720) find risk factors like those in modern data in stocks extending back to the 19th century.

<sup id="f5"> 5 </sup> Imagine $10,000 invested in the ways I described above. Over 39.5 years, a 9.28% average annual return would yield a final value of $332,900; a 9.42% return would yield $350,200; a 9.66% return would yield $381,900; and a 9.84% return would yield $407,400.

<sup id="f7"> 7 </sup> A common argument one hears is that geographic diversification can offer some protection against downturns in the US. It would be nice if the stock markets of different countries crashed independently of one another, so a globally diversified portfolio would have a smooth ride upward. But different stock markets are [positively correlated](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/Global-equity-investing-The-benefits-of-diversification-and-sizing-your-allocation-US-ISGGEB_042021_Online.pdf#page=6), and this is most true during crashes. Don't expect geographic diversification to act as a cushion during crashes.

There are many ways to argue more convincingly for geographic diversification. The first is to note that there are country-specific risks. The US may experience unexpectedly high inflation. This would cause lenders to anticipate further high inflation and raise interest rates. The US stock market would then suffer because rising interest rates mean companies pay more to borrow money, reducing their expected growth. Inflation is sometimes caused by factors that do not affect all countries equally, so diversification offers mild protection against inflation risk, one example of a country-specific risk.

This [video on bear markets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh9Gn58r9Fw) from Ben Felix is a great discussion of the psychological terror of market crashes. It also contains a powerful argument for diversification based on the Japanese stock market. Japan's market grew at a breathtaking pace in the 1970s and 1980s, then crashed in 1990 and performed very poorly for two decades. From 1990 onward, a Japanese investor with a portfolio of 100% Japanese stocks would have deeply regretted their lack of diversification. But someone who allocated 45% to Japan according to global cap weights at the time would have benefited from superior growth in other countries like the US. As [this paper](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/International-Diversification-Works-Eventually) put it, "Diversification protects investors against the adverse effects of holding concentrated positions in countries with poor long-term economic performance. Let us not fail to appreciate the benefits of this protection." Ben Felix also points out that Japanese small cap value stocks have outperformed the total market, which supports risk factor diversification. I am not claiming that the US stock market is likely to stagnate; I am saying that the future is uncertain and diversification provides moderate protection from certain risks without any clear drawbacks.

I expand more on the errors of US home country bias in [this footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f1) to the risk section. [↩](#fn7)
